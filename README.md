This is the newest version based in my new [article series](https://medium.com/@daniel.kuroski/confident-js-series-part-3-test-what-improves-your-confidence-9e9b5b6282f2)

It is still the same project, but I'm applying a few concepts that I showed in parts 1 and 2 of the series.

It is still the same project, we want to:

> Display a Github user profile by searching for its username

The project only handles the happy path, and we are **not handling** the loading and error states on purpose, to keep the project simple.

In future article parts, I will show how to handle those.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit

# or

npm run test:unit:watch
```
